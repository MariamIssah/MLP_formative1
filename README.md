# Climate Data Management System

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline project for managing and analyzing climate data. This system provides RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on climate data records.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is part of our Machine Learning Pipeline formative assignment, focusing on building a robust backend system for climate data management. The system handles data ingestion, storage, retrieval, and manipulation, serving as the foundation for future machine learning applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Retrieval**: Fetch climate data records with configurable limits
- **Data Creation**: Add new climate data entries to the database
- **Data Updates**: Modify existing climate data records
- **Data Deletion**: Remove climate data records from the system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling and logging
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better code maintainability

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI (implied by SQLAlchemy usage)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL (configurable)
- **Python**: 3.8+
- **Logging**: Built-in Python logging module
